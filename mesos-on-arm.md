# Mesos on ARM

Get mesos up and running on arm.  We did not yet succeed but have
identified issues and are working through them.

Some things that will affect the wider mesos world will be the following:

- Upgrading zookeeper.
- Upgrading leveldb.
- Documenting how to use distcc to speed up mesos builds.
